# 📌 JavaScript Basics
🚀 JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language used for web development, backend services, game development, and more.

## 📜 JavaScript Data Types
JavaScript has two main categories of data types:

### 🔹 1. Primitive Data Types (Stored by Value)
// Example
let name = "Alice";  // String
let age = 25;        // Number

### 🔹 2. Non-Primitive (Reference) Data Types (Stored by Reference)
// Example
let person = { name: "Alice", age: 25 }; // Object
let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4]; // Array
function greet() { console.log("Hello!"); } // Function


## 🔄 Type Conversion in JavaScript
JavaScript supports automatic and manual type conversion.


### 🚀 Summary
✔ JavaScript has Primitive (String, Number, Boolean, etc.) and Non-Primitive (Object, Array, Function) data types.
✔ Implicit Type Conversion happens automatically in JS operations.
✔ Explicit Type Conversion is done using String(), Number(), and Boolean().
