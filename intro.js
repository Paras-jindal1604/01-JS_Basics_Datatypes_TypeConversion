//! JavaScript is a high-level, interpreted programming language primarily used to create interactive and dynamic content on websites. It is one of the core technologies of web development, along with HTML and CSS.



//* ðŸ”¹ Key Features of JavaScript:

// ? Client-Side Scripting:  Runs in the browser to make web pages dynamic.
//? Interpreted Language: No need for compilation; executed directly by the browser.
//? Event-Driven: Responds to user actions like clicks, keypresses, and mouse movements.
//? Asynchronous & Single-Threaded: Uses concepts like callbacks, promises, and async/await for handling operations.
//? Versatile: Can be used for both frontend (browser) and backend (server-side with Node.js).



//* ðŸ”¹ Where is JavaScript Used?

//? Web Development: Interactive UI, animations, pop-ups, form validation, etc.
//? Web Apps: Frameworks like React.js, Angular, and Vue.js.
//? Backend Development: Using Node.js.
//? Game Development: HTML5 Canvas & WebGL.
//? Mobile Apps: Using React Native, Ionic, etc.

//*  What is ECMAScript (ES)?

//?  ECMAScript (ES) is the standard that defines the core rules and features of the JavaScript language. It is maintained by ECMA International through the TC39 committee. JavaScript is an implementation of ECMAScript, just like how web browsers follow HTML and CSS standards.


//*  ðŸ”¹ Why ECMAScript?

//? Before ECMAScript, JavaScript versions were inconsistent across different browsers. To ensure uniformity, ECMAScript was introduced as a standard that browsers follow when implementing JavaScript.



//* What is a JavaScript Engine?

//? A JavaScript engine is a program that interprets and executes JavaScript code in a computer or web browser. It takes your JavaScript code, converts it into machine code, and then runs it efficiently.
//? Every browser has its own JavaScript engine to execute JavaScript code.

//^ ðŸŸ¢ V8 (used in Chrome & Node.js) is the most popular JS engine.
